**Each customer will have chosen and signed for which level of liability they wanted on the day of the move.**


1. Basic Value: This option means you decided that if you’re shipment, or any part thereof is damaged or lost, Midway’s maximum liability is thirty cents per pound per article. The weight of any article can be
derived from “The American Movers Conference Table of Weights and Depreciation Guide.”

2. Declared Value: This option means you decided to place a maximum value on your entire shipment and you indicated this total on our contract on the day of your move. This means that if your shipment, or any part thereof is damaged or lost, Midway’s maximum liability will be the lowest of either the repair cost, the original cost less the depreciation to the date of the loss, or the declared value.

3. Please: Avoid including information not related to describing specific damage or loss. Other issues will not apply.

4. Please Note: Claims are processed in the order they are received. Upon receipt of your claim, we will send you a confirmation letter. From this point it may take up to 45 days to process your claim. We appreciate your patience. We are not able to accept verbal communications regarding your claim. Please, no phone calls. Only written documentation can influence any judgment regarding your claim.

5. ￼￼￼Please return the completed claim form to Claims Department.



￼MIDWAY’S EXCLUSIONS
=====

Midway Moving & Storage CUSTOMER CLAIM FORM
------

1. In the absence of other proof, Midway is not liable for mechanical or electrical malfunction of washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, television sets, audio and computer equipment etc. These devices often fail for reasons other than transportation or from normal vibration incidental to transportation. Proper servicing before and after shipping is the customer’s responsibility, except for shipments moving under a United States Government bill of lading where servicing is included in the transportation rate. Until or unless Midway acknowledges liability, service calls to inspect or repair said defects are at the risk and expense of the customer.
2. Claims for lost items packed by the customer, when the customer acknowledges receipt of all articles, will not be honored by Midway. Confirmed losses will be traced by Midway. Tracing procedures often take up to ninety days from the time Midway receives an adequate description of the missing item(s) from the customer.

Additional Notes:
-------

**If I (Andrew Luhring) had not been told that I was required to choose the basic value option of $0.30 per pound per article, I would not have chosen that value option-- I was not never informed of the fact that it was an _OPTION_ when I was being _rushed_ and _intimidated_ to quickly sign the materials at my house. I was also being _rushed_ through the same procedure at the warehouse when I had to fill out forms to have my stuff released to me. I have audio documentation of both of those events and of most interactions that I had with Midway Moving and Storage.**

**From what I recall, I was never given [this](https://www.protectyourmove.gov/pdf.aspx?status=yes&redirect=/documents/Rights-and-Responsibilities-2013.pdf) as is required by federal law**

**They made me sign a receipt before they even started packing. I never got a receipt for the packing. They charged me more than they said they were going to without my permission.**

**The written estimate I received was for packing and moving was $1147.50 and it was given to me after the packing process had been completed. They charged me $1458.00 that day. The next day they charged me $792.50. They then charged me $467 for warehouse fees. The total cost as of this point has been $2,718.**
