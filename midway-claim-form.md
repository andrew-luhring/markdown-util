Each customer will have chosen and signed for which level of liability they wanted on the day of the move.
------

1. Basic Value: This option means you decided that if you’re shipment, or any part thereof is damaged or lost, Midway’s maximum liability is thirty cents per pound per article. The weight of any article can be
derived from “The American Movers Conference Table of Weights and Depreciation Guide.”

2. Declared Value: This option means you decided to place a maximum value on your entire shipment and you indicated this total on our contract on the day of your move. This means that if your shipment, or any part thereof is damaged or lost, Midway’s maximum liability will be the lowest of either the repair cost, the original cost less the depreciation to the date of the loss, or the declared value.

3. Please: Avoid including information not related to describing specific damage or loss. Other issues will not apply.

4. Please Note: Claims are processed in the order they are received. Upon receipt of your claim, we will send you a confirmation letter. From this point it may take up to 45 days to process your claim. We appreciate your patience. We are not able to accept verbal communications regarding your claim. Please, no phone calls. Only written documentation can influence any judgment regarding your claim.

5. ￼￼￼Please return the completed claim form to Claims Department.

Midway Moving & Storage CUSTOMER CLAIM FORM
=====

1. In the absence of other proof, Midway is not liable for mechanical or electrical malfunction of washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, television sets, audio and computer equipment etc. These devices often fail for reasons other than transportation or from normal vibration incidental to transportation. Proper servicing before and after shipping is the customer’s responsibility, except for shipments moving under a United States Government bill of lading where servicing is included in the transportation rate. Until or unless Midway acknowledges liability, service calls to inspect or repair said defects are at the risk and expense of the customer.
2. Claims for lost items packed by the customer, when the customer acknowledges receipt of all articles, will not be honored by Midway. Confirmed losses will be traced by Midway. Tracing procedures often take up to ninety days from the time Midway receives an adequate description of the missing item(s) from the customer.
